Contributions to the Automation Robotics and Mechatronics Lab, CUICAR

## My Contributions:
1. Performed component sizing studies and sensor selection, along with overall vehicle control architecture design for a go-kart conversion project to leverage full autonomous capabilities using a drive-by-wire system.
2. Currently working on a 4-wheel steering control strategy using a model predictive controller for a scaled robot, for low and high-speed applications.
3. Developed a vehicle model on Simulink, taking four independent road wheel angles as input and incorporating decoupled longitudinal dynamics to facilitate torque vectoring capabilities. Redesigned the chassis of the scaled robot to incorporate individual steering actuators at each wheel end.
